# Mirador + OCR Angular Performance Test

I noticed (minor) performance issues when using [Mirador](https://github.com/ProjectMirador/mirador) with the [mirador-textoverlay](https://github.com/dbmdz/mirador-textoverlay) plugin in another Angular project. This repository was created as a minimal sample environment to debug these issues.
